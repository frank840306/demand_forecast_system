				'description' : 'Theory of Electrophoresis and Diffusiophoresis of Highly Charged Colloidal Particles investigates the electrophoretic and diffusiophoretic behaviors of highly charged particles with theoretical approaches by rigorously solving the complete general electrokinetic equations numerically, without any simplifications or approximations. It examines in detail the features that are pertinent to highly charged particles. Special attention is given to the polarization effect that is by far the most important one. This book provides realistic predictions for the electrophoretic mobility of highly charged particles such as proteins and DNAs, which are of great interest in the field of biochemistry and biomedical applications. Further this book provides extensive treatments of the non-rigid colloidal systems of practical interests such as the liquid droplets, pores, porous systems and gels, in addition to the convectional rigid particles. As a result, it serves as a very useful tool for chemical engineers or research scientists by providing easy-to-apply charts to either interpret their experimental data or explore feasibility of novel designs in practical operations.',

				'description' : 'Case Studies in Public Health contains selected case studies of some of the most important and influential moments in medicine and epidemiology. The cases chosen for this collection represent a wide array of public health issues that go into the makeup of what can be termed the New Public Health (NPH), which includes traditional public health, such as sanitation, hygiene and infectious disease control, but widens its perspective to include the organization, financing and quality of health care services in a much broader sense. Each case study is presented in a systematic fashion to facilitate learning, with the case, background, current relevance, economic issues, ethical issues, conclusions, recommendation and references discussed for each case. The book is a valuable resource for advanced students and researchers with specialized knowledge who need further information on the general background and history of public health and important scientific discoveries within the field. It is an ideal resource for students in public health, epidemiology, medicine, anthropology, and sociology, and for those interested in how to apply lessons from the past to present and future research.',

control. This text then examines the relative merits of digital and analog displays \
and computers. Other chapters consider the basic industrial annunciators and \
other alarm systems, which consist of multiple individual alarm points that are \
connected to a trouble contact, a logic module, and a visual indicator. This book \
discusses as well the data loggers available for process control applications. The \
final chapter deals with the various pump control systems, the features and designs \

				'description' : 'Currently, the acquisition of seismic surveys is performed \
as a sequential operation in which shots are computed separately, one after \
the other. This approach is similar to that of multiple-access technology, \
which is widely used in cellular communications to allow several subscribers \
to share the same telephone line. The cost of performing various shots \
simultaneously is almost identical to that of one shot; thus, the savings in \
time and money expected from using the multishooting approach for computing \
seismic surveys compared to the current approach are enormous. By using this \
approach, the long-standing problem of simulating a three-dimensional seismic \
survey can be reduced to a matter of weeks and not years, as is currently the case.',
