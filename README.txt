You can execute the program by typing './run.sh go' in the root folder of my project.

I have finished the part of analyzing the consumer data and building the analysis model.

But I am still working on the UI of my platform and the whole system will be executed successfully when the the interaction of the GUI is finished. It will be OK when demo.

Current GUI was written in HTML named "mainPage.html" and the language of backend is python3.
